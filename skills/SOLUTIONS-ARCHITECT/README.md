\# Claude Code Solutions Architect Skill



Gold-standard skill for designing and building sophisticated Claude Code solutions when everything else has failed.



\## What This Skill Does



This skill helps you \*\*build\*\* (not just use) complex Claude Code solutions for your toughest scenarios:

\- Complex multi-file bugs with unclear root causes

\- Cascading failures where one fix breaks other parts

\- Deployment issues and environment configuration problems

\- Context exhaustion (agents running out of tokens mid-investigation)

\- Production-only issues that are hard to reproduce



\## This is NOT Generic Advice



This skill creates \*\*last-resort solutions\*\* with:

\- Sophisticated multi-agent orchestration

\- Context management as a first-class concern

\- Enforcement mechanisms (not hope-based)

\- Learning loops that improve over time

\- Safety nets and rollback capabilities



\## How It Works



The skill operates collaboratively in 5 phases:



\### Phase 1: Problem Discovery

Interactive questions to understand:

\- What type of issue?

\- Where does context get lost?

\- What are success criteria?

\- What must never happen?



\### Phase 2: Architecture Selection

Recommends patterns from:

\- Specialized Subagent

\- Sequential Workflow

\- Parallel Consensus

\- Hierarchical Orchestration

\- Context-Managed Pipeline

\- Enforcement Framework



\### Phase 3: Detailed Design

Expands chosen pattern into specifications:

\- Agent/subagent contracts

\- Workflow phases

\- Safety mechanisms

\- Learning integration



\### Phase 4: Implementation

Generates actual artifacts:

\- Agent files (`.claude/agents/`)

\- Command files (`.claude/commands/`)

\- Hook files (`.claude/hooks/`)

\- Scripts (`.claude/scripts/`)

\- Documentation



\### Phase 5: Testing \& Refinement

\- Validation walkthrough

\- Edge case analysis

\- Documentation review

\- Iteration based on feedback

\## When to Use This Skill



✅ \*\*Perfect for\*\*:

\- Designing multi-agent orchestration systems

\- Building sophisticated debugging frameworks

\- Creating enforcement mechanisms

\- Solving context exhaustion problems

\- Building learning systems

\- Last-resort scenarios



❌ \*\*Not needed for\*\*:

\- Simple one-off tasks

\- Standard Claude Code usage

\- Generic advice

\- When existing solutions work



\## Example Solutions This Skill Can Build



1\. \*\*Investigation Framework\*\* - Systematic debugging with subagent, checkpoints, context compression

2\. \*\*Consensus Validation System\*\* - 5 parallel analyses in git worktrees for critical decisions

3\. \*\*Deployment Guardian\*\* - Enforced checklist with validation gates

4\. \*\*Context-Managed Pipeline\*\* - Long-running investigations with aggressive compression

5\. \*\*Hierarchical Analysis\*\* - Coordinator with domain specialists



\## Key Features



\### Context Management Expertise

Biggest failure mode in agentic systems. Every solution addresses:

\- How context is preserved across handoffs

\- What gets checkpointed and when

\- How to prevent context loss

\- Strategies for compression and filtering



\### Enforcement Over Hope

Don't rely on LLM memory - enforce mechanically:

\- Claude Code hooks to mandate behaviors

\- State files to track progress

\- Validation scripts to verify compliance

\- Automatic rollbacks on failures



\### Solution Diversity

Different problem classes need different architectures. This skill knows them all.



\## What Makes This "Gold Standard"



1\. \*\*Addresses Context Exhaustion\*\* - The #1 failure mode

2\. \*\*Sophisticated Orchestration\*\* - Multi-agent patterns for complex scenarios

3\. \*\*Enforcement Built-In\*\* - Guarantees correct behavior

4\. \*\*Learning Loops\*\* - Improves over time

5\. \*\*Safety First\*\* - Git checkpoints, rollbacks, validation

6\. \*\*Collaborative Design\*\* - Works with you, not prescriptive



\## Installation



Upload the `.skill` file to Claude Code via the Skills menu.



\## Usage



Once installed, trigger the skill by asking Claude to help build a complex solution:



> "I need to build a sophisticated debugging framework that handles context exhaustion and cascading failures. It's for my last resort when everything else fails."



The skill will engage and collaboratively design the solution.
