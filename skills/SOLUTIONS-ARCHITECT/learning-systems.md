\# Learning Systems for Claude Code Solutions



\*This reference provides patterns for building learning loops that improve solutions over time.\*



\## Coming Soon



This reference will cover:

\- Outcome documentation patterns

\- Pattern recognition systems

\- Confidence calibration tracking

\- Cross-session learning

\- Memory bank integration

\- Success template building



For now, refer to the systematic debugging examples in your existing workflows for learning patterns.



\## Quick Pattern: Outcome Documentation



```markdown

\# Outcome Template



\## Problem

\[What was wrong]



\## Attempted Solution

\[What was tried]



\## Result

\- Success/Failure

\- Confidence predicted: X%

\- Actual difficulty: \[Matched/Easier/Harder]



\## Learnings

\[What was discovered]



\## Pattern

\[Type of problem: deployment/multi-file/cascade/etc]

```



Store outcomes in `.workflow/outcomes/` and build pattern database over time.
