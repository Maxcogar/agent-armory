      <question>Among all projects tracked in AgentBoard, find the one that has progressed the furthest through the phase workflow (i.e., the highest current phase number). Then examine that project's activity log and find all entries where a document was approved. Looking at the very FIRST document approval (by timestamp), retrieve the approved document and provide its exact title as stored in the database.</question>

      <question>In AgentBoard, find a project whose idea mentions "MCP evaluation questions". That project has milestone tasks forming a dependency chain. Starting from the ONLY milestone whose status is 'done', follow the chain forward through tasks that depend on it (i.e., find the task whose depends_on includes the done task's ID, then find the task that depends on THAT one, and so on). What is the title of the milestone that is exactly 4 hops away from the completed one? Provide the full title string.</question>
